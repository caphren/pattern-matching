A Java class to build the complete (compressed, compact-form) suffix trie for a DNA sequence.
There is also a static method which finds the longest common string segment in two DNA sequences. It does not use the Trie, rather it's a brute-force search.

This was written for an uni assignment in Data Structures & Algorithms.
